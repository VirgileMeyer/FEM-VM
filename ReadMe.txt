This Code will compute the vibration of a rectangular plate using the finite element method

Boundary Condition : 
 - ‘Clamped *4’

The elements used are of the “plate type” : 4 nodes with 3 degrees of freedom at each node
(1 for displacement, 2 for in-plane rotation)


Input values (e.g.. Young’Modulus, geometry, number of nodes…) are written in ‘plate_value.py’
(beginning of the file)

Run the file ‘Plate_EF.py’ to plot the displacement field

Run the file ‘eigenfreq.py’ to compute the eigenfrequencies (free vibration)
